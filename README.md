## About

Scratch Addons is a WebExtension (supports both Chrome and Firefox). Scratch Addons' mission is to combine all existing Scratch extensions, userscripts and userstyles into a single easy-to-access place, while still letting users choose which ones to enable.

### What's actually an "addon"?

An addon is similar to an extension or a userscript, but they use special APIs provided by the Scratch Addons extension. These APIs allow addons to run scripts on a Scratch page (userscripts), run scripts on the background (persistent scripts), or apply styles to the Scratch website (userstyles).

Userscripts and persistent scripts can use the `addon.*` JavaScript APIs, which allow them to obtain Scratch-related information (for example, get the current logged in user) and also use extension APIs (like sending notifications).

Converting an already existing extension/userscript into an addon, or writing your own, is very easy. [Check out the guide](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/wiki/Creating-an-addon).

### If everything is an addon, then what does Scratch Addons do?

Scratch Addons by itself is just an addon loader. Its main tasks are:

- Allow users to enable, disable and configure addons.
- Run addons and provide APIs to them.
- Provide global state to addons (for example, the `addon.auth` API).
- Pollute prototypes for use by addon userscripts.
- Provide ways to access and modify Redux state.
- Avoid addons from interfering with each other.
- Avoid duplicate work from different addons.

### Addons outside of Scratch Addons itself

Other extensions (and even forks of Scratch) can also provide their users with most addons from Scratch Addons, as long as a compatibility layer for `addon.*` and other parts of the addon loader is present. Notable examples are the [Scratch 3 Developer Tools extension](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/DevtoolsExtension) and the [TurboWarp](https://github.com/TurboWarp/scratch-gui/tree/develop/src/addons) editor. These also inherit translations from the Scratch Addons project.
