## About

Scratch Addons combines new and existing features and themes for the [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) website and project editor into one easy-to-access and configurable browser extension. The mission is to provide a centralized, up-to-date platform for community development of new features and themes for Scratch.

### About addons

An addon mainly consists of one or more [userscripts](https://scratchaddons.com/docs/develop/userscripts/) (written in JavaScript) or [userstyles](https://scratchaddons.com/docs/develop/userstyles/) (written in CSS) that run on the Scratch website or project editor.

Each addon declares its own [addon manifest](https://scratchaddons.com/docs/reference/addon-manifest/) (`addon.json` file). This file specifies under which circumstances each one of its userscripts and userstyles should be injected into the page. It also contains user-facing information, such as the description of the feature, and information about the addon's settings.

Userscripts work similarly to [extension content scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts) running in the "main world" (the unprivileged context where `chrome.*` extension APIs are not available). Userscripts have access to `addon.*` APIs. They can use these built-in utilities for various purposes: waiting until a certain element exists on the page, listening to settings change events, getting a reference to the Scratch VM object, etc.

Addons are designed to be compatible with each other. They are also developed with performance, internationalization, accessibility, and privacy in mind.

Read the [documentation](https://scratchaddons.com/docs/develop/getting-started/addon-basics/) for more information about addons.

### About the extension

The Scratch Addons browser extension provides a settings page where users can enable, disable and configure addons. The extension interprets addon manifests, stores the user's settings, and provides APIs to userscripts. A new version of the extension is released to the stores regularly with new addons and features.

### Addons beyond the Scratch Addons browser extension

Other open-source projects (such as Scratch forks) can also make use of the addons. For example, the [TurboWarp](https://github.com/TurboWarp/scratch-gui/tree/develop/src/addons) and [Adacraft](https://gitlab.com/adacraft/scratch-mod/scratch-gui/-/tree/adacraft/main/src/addons) project editors allow you to use most of the editor addons without installing browser extensions, and even while offline ([TurboWarp Desktop](https://desktop.turbowarp.org/)).

### File structure

#### Addons
- `addons-l10n`: Translation for addon strings (one file per addon).
- `addon-api`: Implementation of the `addon.*` JavaScript APIs.
- `addons`: Each addon has its own directory, which must include an addon manifest file named `addon.json`.
- `libraries`: Third-party libraries and other utilities, some of which are used by addons.

#### Others
- `.github`: GitHub templates, workflows, and contributing files.
- `_locales`: Translation strings for the browser extension (excluding addons).
- `background`: Background scripts for the extension.
- `content-scripts`: Content scripts, which among other things, execute userscripts and inject userstyles to the page.
- `images`: Logos, screenshots and icons (excluding addon-specific images).
- `popups`: Addon pages that are only accessible through the extension popup (for example, Scratch Messaging).
- `webpages`: The settings page, extension popup, and other pages.

## Installation

No building is required. The best way to download the source is with Git:

### Loading the extension (Firefox)

Go to `about:debugging`, select "This Firefox", click "Load Temporary Add-on...", and select the `manifest.json` file in the `ScratchAddons` folder.
