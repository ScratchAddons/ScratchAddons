# Talk with ChatGPT on Scratch

This is a Tampermonkey script that adds a handy **Talk with ChatGPT** button on Scratch’s website.  
It lets you chat with ChatGPT right on Scratch without switching tabs. You can pick from some free models that don’t need an API key, or use the official OpenAI ones if you have a key.

---

## What it does

- Puts a button on the top-right corner when you’re on Scratch.
- When you click it, a panel pops up to chat with ChatGPT.
- You can choose between:
  - `(FREE) GPT-3.5 (mubi.tech)` — no API key needed
  - `(FREE) GPT-3.5 (tmrace.net)` — no API key needed
  - `(FREE) gpt-3.5-turbo` — official, needs API key
  - `(Paid) gpt-4` — official, needs API key
  - `(Paid) gpt-4o` — official, needs API key
- Saves your API key and chat history in your browser so you don’t have to enter them again.
- Shows your previous questions and answers every time you open the panel.

## How to get it running

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) if you don’t have it yet.
2. Create a new userscript and paste the script code there.
3. Save and reload Scratch.
4. Look for the green **Talk with ChatGPT** button on the top-right.

## How to use

1. Click the button to open the chat window.
2. If you want to use the official OpenAI models, put your API key in the box.
3. Pick the model you want to use.
4. Ask your question and hit send.
5. Your conversation will be saved and shown in the panel.
6. Close the panel by clicking the button again.

## A few things to keep in mind

- The free models are cool because you don’t need an API key, but they might be slower or sometimes offline.
- If you use official OpenAI models, don’t share your API key with anyone.
- Your chats and key stay only in your browser — nowhere else.
- This only works on Scratch pages.
