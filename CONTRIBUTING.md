Contributions are welcome! Be sure to file an issue first (see above). If you know a fix for that issue, or you know a fix for a different one, you can create a pull request. Fork this repository, create a new branch from the 'master' branch, and make your changes on the new branch. Now, create a pull request on the origin repository (ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons).
